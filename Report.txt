Random Forest - We choose this model due to its greater accuracy for prediction.Concept constituted to create the random forest model is "Wisdom of Crowds". In other terms, the core point helping the random forest to give way better accuracy than other models is "Large number of relative uncorrelated models(trees) operating as a group will be able to give much more accuracy than any individual constituent models". So by this reason we chose Random Forest as one of the models for prediction.

MLP Classifier(Multi-Layer Perceptron) - Perceptron is defined as a linear classifier that classifies input by separating into two categories with a straight line. For example: cat or not cat. When more than one perceptron is used than it becomes a multilayer perceptron(MLP) which creates a deep artificial neural network. It is composed of an input layer to receive the signal and an output layer that makes the prediction or decision about the input but in between(those input & output layers) there are an arbitrary number of hidden layers that do the true computation for the classifier. The classifier gets trained on set of input-output pairs and learns the correlation(or dependencies) between those inputs and outputs. Also in training it adjusts the parameters, weights and biases dynamically in order to minimize the error. It also uses the back propogation to make those weight and bias adjustment relative to the error and the error itself can be measured in a variety of ways, including by root mean squared error (RMSE). This leads us to select this model for better prediction.
